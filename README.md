# internship projects SUMMER 2025

3 Main Projects = Automated Guided Vehicle, Desiging New Inspection Table and Improvement on Cyclone Filtering System (Hose)
*did other smaller tasks with PowerApps, Lean Manufacturing Concepts (details in presentation)

1. AGV at Cylinder Block KR line : 

  Problem : Team Members (Operators) need to manually carry Cylinder Block to Teiji Teriyo Table (Inspection Table).
  - might cause back problems and less efficient in using workforce

  Solution : using AGV to reduce workload on Team Member without adding more manpower nor downtime

2. Inspection Table : 

  Problem : initially due to cleaning and aesthetics issue (previous table uses aluminium frame). but i've identified other improvements can be made (more details in presentation link below)

  Solution : fully designed new Inspection Table with a universal design to be used in other manufacturing line as well

3. Improvement on Cyclone Filtering System (Hose) :

   Problem : Hose intake didnt cover enough space of the tank, causing unfiltered residues in the tank

   Solution : designing an attachment to stick the hose at a proper position inside the tank, allowing consistent and smooth flow
